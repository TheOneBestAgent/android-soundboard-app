- **Result:** Local audio files from Android now play successfully on computer speakers
- **Technical Details:** 
  - Fixed path handling in server/src/audio/AudioPlayer.js
  - Added proper file extension handling in server/src/server.js
  - Absolute paths (temp files) now bypass basename stripping
  - Relative paths still use security measures to prevent directory traversal

## Immediate Blockers
