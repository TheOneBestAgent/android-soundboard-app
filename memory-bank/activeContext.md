# Active Context: Android Soundboard Application

## Current Focus
**Phase:** Phase 5.7 - LAYOUT SELECTION BUG FIX COMPLETED âœ…  
**Status:** Fixed critical bug where layout selection in Layout Manager wasn't working. Root cause was that switchToLayout() method was using separate updateLayout() calls instead of the atomic switchActiveLayout() transaction method. This caused race conditions preventing proper layout switching. Updated ViewModel to use repository.switchActiveLayout() and fixed type mismatch (Long vs Int) in DAO methods. Layout selection now works correctly with atomic database transactions.

## Recent Bug Fixes (Phase 5.1.2) âœ… COMPLETE
### App Restart Connection Issue Resolution
- **Root Cause:** When app is closed and reopened, Socket.IO reconnects successfully but currentServerUrl becomes null, causing local audio HTTP requests to fail
- **Fix Applied:** Added intelligent server URL reconstruction in SoundboardRepository
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - Created `getServerUrl()` method that reconstructs server URL from connection history when currentServerUrl is null
  - Added `getOrCreateApiService()` method that recreates API service after app restart
  - Updated all HTTP request methods to use URL reconstruction logic
  - Fallback to localhost:8080 for USB connections when connection history unavailable
- **Result:** Local audio files now work correctly after app close/reopen cycle
- **Methods Updated:** uploadAndPlayAudioData(), getAvailableAudioFiles(), testServerConnection()

## Previous Bug Fixes (Phase 5.1.1) âœ… COMPLETE
### Audio Playback Issue Resolution
- **Root Cause:** AudioPlayer.js was stripping absolute paths using path.basename(), causing temp files to be looked for in wrong directory
- **Fix Applied:** Modified getFullAudioPath() to handle absolute paths directly while maintaining security for relative paths
- **File Extension Fix:** Server now ensures proper audio file extensions (.mp3, .wav, etc.) on temporary files
- **Result:** Local audio files from Android now play successfully on computer speakers
- **Technical Details:** 
  - Fixed path handling in server/src/audio/AudioPlayer.js
  - Added proper file extension handling in server/src/server.js
  - Absolute paths (temp files) now bypass basename stripping
  - Relative paths still use security measures to prevent directory traversal

## Immediate Blockers
