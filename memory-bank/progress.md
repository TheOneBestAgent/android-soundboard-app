**Current Phase**: 5.7 → 6.0 (Priority #1 Critical Fixes COMPLETED ✅)

## PRIORITY #1: CRITICAL FIXES - STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED & VERIFIED
**All critical connection stability issues have been successfully resolved**

### ✅ 1.1 Port Management Loop Fix (COMPLETED)
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested
- **Issue**: Infinite "Port forwarding already established" logging spam
- **Solution**: Implemented device state change detection with `lastDeviceState` tracking
- **Result**: Server only logs device changes, not every 3-second check
- **Code**: `server/src/server.js` - Enhanced device monitoring logic

### ✅ 1.2 EADDRINUSE Port Conflict (COMPLETED) 
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested
- **Issue**: Server crashes when port 3001 is already in use
- **Solution**: Added process cleanup + better error handling with troubleshooting commands
- **Result**: Clean server startup without port conflicts
- **Verification**: Server successfully started and responding to health checks

### ✅ 1.3 Audio File Not Found Errors (COMPLETED)
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested  
- **Issue**: "Audio file not found" errors during audio forwarding
- **Solution**: Comprehensive temp file management with validation and cleanup
- **Result**: Proper temp directory creation, file validation, and scheduled cleanup
- **Code**: `server/src/server.js` - Enhanced `forward_audio` handler

### ✅ 1.4 Connection Timeout Management (COMPLETED)
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested
- **Issue**: Repeated connection spam and disconnect cycles

- **Result**: Clean connection logs without repeated forwarding attempts
- **Code**: `server/src/network/AdbManager.js` - Enhanced forwarding logic

### ✅ 1.5 Socket.io Disconnect/Reconnect Loop (COMPLETED)
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested
- **Issue**: Android app continuously disconnecting and reconnecting every few seconds
- **Root Cause**: Protocol mismatch - Android app expected authentication but server didn't handle it
- **Secondary Issue**: Transport errors due to restrictive Socket.io configuration
- **Solution**: 
  - Added authentication handler to match Android app expectations
  - Improved Socket.io transport configuration (polling + websocket for localhost)
  - Enhanced error handling for transport errors with delayed reconnection
  - Added connection state recovery and increased timeouts
- **Result**: Stable socket connections without rapid connect/disconnect cycles
- **Code**: 
  - `server/src/server.js` - Added `authenticate` event handler with proper response
  - `app/src/main/java/com/soundboard/android/network/SocketManager.kt` - Enhanced transport configuration
  - Server: Better transport handling, connection tracking, and error management

## VERIFICATION RESULTS ✅
- ✅ Server starts without EADDRINUSE errors
