# Product Context: Android Soundboard Application

## Why This Project Exists
The project addresses the need for a portable, wireless soundboard solution that provides professional-grade audio control capabilities. Current solutions like Elgato Streamdeck are hardware-dependent and limited to physical proximity to the computer.

## Problems We're Solving
- **Mobility Limitation:** Traditional soundboards require physical connection or proximity
- **Cost Barrier:** Hardware soundboards can be expensive and require additional equipment
- **Flexibility:** Need for customizable, software-based solution that can adapt to different use cases
- **Remote Control:** Content creators need ability to trigger audio from anywhere in their space

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Interface:** Touch-friendly design optimized for tablet screens
- **Instant Response:** Near-zero latency between button press and audio playback
- **Visual Feedback:** Clear indication of button states and connection status
- **Easy Setup:** Simple pairing process between tablet and computer
- **Customization:** Ability to organize, label, and customize sound buttons
- **Reliability:** Stable connection that works consistently during live streaming/recording

## Target Use Cases
- **Live Streaming:** Streamers triggering sound effects, music stings, or voice clips
- **Podcasting:** Hosts playing intro/outro music, sound effects, or transition audio
- **Live Events:** Sound technicians controlling audio cues from remote locations
- **Music Production:** Musicians triggering samples or backing tracks during performances
- **Content Creation:** Video creators adding audio elements during recording

## Success Metrics
- Connection establishes within 5 seconds
- Audio latency under 50ms
- 99%+ uptime during active sessions
- Intuitive enough for first-time use without documentation
